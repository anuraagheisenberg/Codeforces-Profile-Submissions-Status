Codeforces Profile Submission Status

As Codeforces Profile Page doesn't give information about the users submission status like his accuracy, here is a  python script which would give that information

INPUT- Codeforces handle

OUTPUT- Submission status

I have used Codeforces API for this as crawling through the pages would be more time consuming.
